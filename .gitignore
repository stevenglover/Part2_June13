# .gitignore DIME template
# We recommend that you create a .gitignore file using GitHub's tools and 
# replace the content of that file with the content of this file. Otherwise
# you have to rename this file .gitignore. But if you rename the fine in a
# regular folder window PCs and Macs are likely to keep the file extension
# so that the file ends up being names .gitignore.txt. Code editors like, Atom,
# can edit the file extension, but if you are not familiar with how to do that,
# we recommend that you generate an ignore file using GitHub and simply replace
# the content of that file.

# Start by ignoring everything, and below we are explicitly saying
# what to not ignore

#######################
# List of files with GitHub functionality anywhere in the repo
# that we do not want to ignore

# These files include GitHub settings
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# Keep markdown files used for documentation on GitHub
!*.md

#######################
# For performance reasons, if a folder is already ignored, then
# GitHub does not check the content for that folder for matches
# with additional rules. The line below includes folder in the
# top folder (but not their content), so that anything matching
# the rules below will still not be ignored.

#######################
# The following file types are code that should always be
# included no matter where in the repository folder they are
# located unless you explicitly ignore that folder

# Stata
!/**/*.do
!/**/*.ado

# R
!/**/*.R

# LaTeX
!/**/*.tex

# Python
!/**/*.py

# Matlab
!/**/*.m

#######################
# Include some additional file formats in any output folder. You might have
# to change the name of the Output folder to whatever it is called in your
# project, but we strongly recommend that you only include these files in
# a subset of the folders where you are certain no private data is ever stored.
!/**/Output/**/*.txt
!/**/Output/**/*.csv
!/**/Output/**/*.xml
!/**/Output/**/*.eps
!/**/Output/**/*.svg
